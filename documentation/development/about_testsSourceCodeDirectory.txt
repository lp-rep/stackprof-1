-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) sourceCode/tests includes unit tests about StackProfs features

2 Directory naming convention:
  . if the test uses Qt framework, its directory name includes '_Qt_' string
  . if the test does not use the Qt framework, its directory name includes '_noQt_' string

3) Test images and other test data are located in this repository: 
   https://github.com/IPGP/stackprof

|
|
|-- test_noQt_mean_median         | Test about mean, median, absolute deviation around, and weigthing feature
|
|-- test_Qt_anyUi                 | Test just check display of one of .ui

|
|-- test_Qt_exportResults         | Test the results export options combinations. On georeferenced and non georeferenced project.
|                                 | If you want to make a stackprof version without GUI, this test is a starting point.
|

|
|-- test_Qt_numericPrecisionConversion       | Test about formating value with numeric precision
|
|-- test_Qt_orderingBoxAlongRoute            | Test that in different use cases, a box is correctly located in the vector container 'along the trace'
|

|                                            | This test uses the axis projection (axis change by axis oriention)
|

    |
    |-- tool_noQt_generateTestImages         | Generates small images with different value types (float, signed 16 bits, etc) with specific values or random
    |
    `-- tool_noQt_imageFormatConverter       | Convert RGB images to float images, indicating the float values to use from specific RGB colors
        |
        `-- scripts_to_convert_testImages    | various scripts used to convert RGB test images into input images with float or byte data type for stackprof tests
